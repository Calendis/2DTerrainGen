2D Terrain Generator in Python
=================

Introduction
------------

This is a very simple program, not efficiant though it could be useful for those looking for an easy solution to creating a 2D platformer terrain.
Start the program and press space in order to start off the random terrain, keep pressing space to make it look more realistic. This is my own personal twist on Fractals.

Requirements
------------

- In order to run the game, one will need to have installed Python and Pyglet: python.org AND pyglet.org
